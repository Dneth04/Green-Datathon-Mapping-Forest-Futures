## Dataset

We will be working with the FAO Global Forest Insights dataset (1990-2020). This dataset provides a detailed view of forest areas across 236 countries and territories, highlighting changes over three decades.

## Repository Contents

- `tutorial.py`: A step-by-step guide to basic data manipulation using Python and Pandas.
- `starter_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code structure and tasks for the datathon.
- `cheat_sheet.md`: Quick reference for common Python and Pandas operations.
- `Forest_Area.csv`: The dataset we'll be using for analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Refer to `tutorial.py` for a step-by-step guide on how to manipulate the data using Python and Pandas.
3. Use `cheat_sheet.md` as a quick reference for common Python and Pandas operations during your analysis.
4. The `Forest_Area.csv` file contains the data you will be analyzing. Make sure to explore it thoroughly.
